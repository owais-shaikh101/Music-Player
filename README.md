## ðŸŽµ Music Player App

This project is an interactive web-based music player application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It provides a hands-on approach to learning and applying core JavaScript concepts such as arrays, objects, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

The app features a clean and responsive UI that allows users to:

- Play, pause, and skip between tracks
- Shuffle the playlist order
- Delete songs from the playlist
- Visually track the currently playing song

Each song is represented as an object, and the playlist is dynamically rendered based on user interactions. This application is ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of JavaScript data structures and methods in a practical and engaging way.
